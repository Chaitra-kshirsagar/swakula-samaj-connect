                Except Omkar Swarop parabramha, everything on this earth was shunya. Thru the Supreme tejas of Parabramha "adimaya" took birth. Upon instructions from para bramha, the adimaya created Vishnu from her satvaguna and Bramha from Rajoguna,and Maheswar from Tamoguna. She entrusted the responsibility of creation to Bramha,and to ruling by Vishnu and for destruction by Maheswar. Devas and the Manvas were living and travelling nude. In the advent of the nature's heat and cold waves the awareness of protection from such extremeties led to wearing of the Leaves, skin, wooden barks etc around them for covering their bodies. As time passed there was an increase of natural intelligence in them, Hence weaving of cloth from the trees yarn, barks etc was created by them. Hence ADIMAYA requested SHIVA to create a Punya Purusha who can weave exquisite clothes.

                Upon instructions from ADIMAYA, SHIVA created a child form his tongue (JIHVE) in Shravan Masa, Trayodashi, early morning on Monday. The naming ceremony was performed in great pomp at Kailas. The boy was named SALI to assist everybody in weaving the cloth. Godess Parvati named his kula as SWAKULA for promoting in the mankind. As the child was born thru the tongue of Shiva, Godess Parvati named him as "JIHVESHWARA". Also the child was born at the time of Sun rise , hence his Gotra was named as SURYAVAMSHI GOTRA.
