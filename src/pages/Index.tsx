            Except Omkar Swarop parabramha, everything on this earth was shunya. Thru the Supreme tejas of Parabramha "adimaya" took birth. Upon instructions from para bramha, the adimaya created Vishnu from her satvaguna and Bramha from Rajoguna, and Maheswar from Tamoguna. She entrusted the responsibility of creation to Bramha, and to ruling by Vishnu and for destruction by Maheswar.

            Devas and the Manvas were living and travelling nude. In the advent of the nature's heat and cold waves the awareness of protection from such extremeties led to wearing of the Leaves, skin, wooden barks etc around them for covering their bodies. As time passed there was an increase of natural intelligence in them, Hence weaving of cloth from the trees yarn, barks etc was created by them. Hence ADIMAYA requested SHIVA to create a Punya Purusha who can weave exquisite clothes.

After marriage Sri Ananth Maharaj renounced the worldly affairs and stepped out of the house towards the goal of peace by chanting the magic words of Ramakrishna Hari. He is in ardent devotee of Lord Vittala. Sr Ananth Maharaj travelled towards Pandari by praying Vittala.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            He established himself for almost 18 years. He started the "Pandari Varakari" culture and conducted "Bhagavat Sapthah", devotional songs, religious discourses, Dhindi bhajans, etc to promote the bhakti awareness among the people. He expected, not money, but - people to drop their bad habits in his arms and adopt good habits from him thru "harimukhemhana". He expected people to forget "I and mine" feelings, To do the duties as God's work. To share the miseries of others and to take the lead in wiping the tears of pain in people's feelings.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            During the spread of epidemic plague disease, Ananth Maharaj personally nursed and fed many patients. He took care of them like his children, and believed that serving humankind is God's work.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sri Ananth Maharaj used to walk to Pandarapur every year creating an positive awareness about his determination. He was a "miracle" yogi and never used to display in public, but used his powers only if required. Even today his sincere followers depending on his bhakti are protected by his divine power. His close and experienced associates will agree to the above statement.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            He was a power house of Atmagnana, his preaching's were followed diligently by the people, which really complete the purpose of his avatar.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One of the intellect persons like Mr. K.A. Krishna Iyer described the Maharaj as "Parabramha"
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Ananth Maharaj was a pious and simple man, never expected any financial considerations. He refused the offer made by his bhaktas for construction of Ashram.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sri Ananth Maharah reached the abode of god during 1901 (Year – Purvanama, Pushya Shuddha Saptami- Thursday), In the event of Maharaj journey to god's abode, a divine incident took place- Sri Siddaruda Swamiji in Hubli who was performing his pooja and was offering arati to god, suddenly informed the bhaktas around him that Sri Ananth Maharah soul is flying towards KAILAS – then he said OM NAMA SHIVAYA, After this Siddaruda Swamy eyes was in tears. He then left for meditation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sri Ananth Maharaja's life passed very calmly without any pomp and splendor.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Ananth Ashrama in Gandhinagar today is the palce where Sri Ananth Maharaj did his Tapas for the wellbeing of mankind.
          </p>
          
          <h3>A birds eye view of the activities & development of Sri Anantha ashram:</h3>
          <p>
            (sriananthaswamyashram.org) link
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Anantha ashrama was established 85 years ago at Gandhinagar in Bangalore
          </p>
          
          <p>
            SriAnantha swami of the ashram had a universal love and kind approach towards mankind .To quote an example, during the epidemics spread of plague in Bangalore people use to flee away out of distress. He brought many patients to his place and nursed them & most of the people could survive due to his care..
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sr iAnantha Maharaj never expected any monetary assistance from anybody but led a simple life. He was contented with a small piece of cloth tied around him. Many devotees came forward to build an ashram but he refused. After completion of swamiji's worldly affairs he was laid to rest at a place where he has performed his tapas.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The above incident took place in the holy year 1901, which is named as Pushya Shudda saptami(Thursday), and the place is named as Anathashrama. At the first instance four rooms consisting of garbha gruha and the upanyas mandir were constructed. No approach roads were there to visit ashram, some of the devotees helped in constructing road from SC road to ashram. Since it is one of the oldest ashram, many devotees, sadhus, had the opportunity to stay in ashram.

            Swakulasali (also known as Swakula Sali, 'Sakulasale' , Swakulasale. and Sali or Rugwedsali) is an ethnic community found among Hindus in India. They claim descent from the mythological Jihveshwara. Marathi is the primary language spoken by the Swakula Salis, who also speak local dialects. Their primary professions are weaving, designing and dyeing.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Divine and deity Sri Jihveshwar, Shiva's son, born through tongue of Shiva, was ordered by Jaganmata Adimaya to prepare various types of costumes by weaving and designing them for protection of body of entire gods and goddesses.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Fostered by Jaganmata Sri Parvathi, fortunate Shri Jihveshwara being "constume designer Brahma" in Kailasa performed his day to day routine. After getting Brahmopadesha from Lord Brahma himself he completed his study of Vedas in order to attain spirituality and Mukti.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sri Jihveshwara is the first scholar who invented not only the art of weaving strands available in the nature such as cotton and silk with excellent concepts, fascinating amalgamation of natural colours, with expertise of creating costumes in various designs and styles, but also invented tools for preparing these costumes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            He married Ankini and Dashankini, created by Brahma and Saraswathi, in the presence of all gods and goddesses and followed Grahasthashrama. He spread the weaving profession developed by himself through his sons throughout. Four sons of Ankini surrendered themselves in service of Guru and six sons of Dashankini engaged in continuing the task of their father. Various classes of Salis were manifested through them only and spread all over the world as Sali gene. Those who design and weave various types of clothes are 'Sali Community'. Sons of Sri Jihvewshara gradually came down to bhuloka and were introduced as 'Swakulasali Samaj', preparing and distributing costumes to entire humanity. Swakulasalies are 'Vastrakarma Brahmanas' just like Vishwakarma Brahmanas, a semi-brahmin community, who are in the traditional profession of sculpture and making ornaments. There are various gotras of leading maharshis, who follow upanayana and upakarma rituals. They are yajurvedis and followers of Apastanbha principle.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When Kailas was in danger in the absence of Lord Shiva, Sri Jihveshwara wearing weapons, charioteered Devaganas and killed evil forces. Renowned as good warrior Sri Jihveshwara after enjoying worldly grahastha dharma, he received sanyasa deeksha from his father, Parashiva, wore kashambara and attained spiritual target. He administered spirituality to his sons also.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When his parents relaxed in Kashi kshetra as Vishwanath and Vishalakshi, he resided in Kashi in the presence of Shiva as Kalabhairava as per blessings of Shiva, serving him there. There is Sri Jihveshwara (Jihvaji) temple now also in Goghat, wherein daily nanda deep, bhajan and pujas are going on. Though Sri Parameshwara is family deity of Swakulasalis, there is no difference between Hari-Hara, the gods in mind. They are the worshippers of Sri Tulaja Bhavani and Sri Dattatreya too. Without confining to any creed, they are following Smarta rituals. They follow Warakari rituals of Pandharpur also very sincerely. They celebrate all Hindu festivals by devotion.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Swakulasali Community which migrated from Uttaranchal, Kashi origin has settled in Devagiri and Pratistanpur (Paithan) of Maharashtra. It may be observed that sarees of Paithani style are still famous. As they settled in Maharasthra for many centuries original language of Swakulasalis became Marathi. But Swakulasalis are not Marathas (Kshatriyas). When Chatrapathi Shivaji's father Shahajirao Bhonsle and Ghorpade warriors came to south from Maharashtra for battles, Swakulasalis who accompanied them went towards south and settled in Karnataka and Andhra regions. Though Marathi is their mother tongue they have embraced regional languages affectionately for business and education. Gradually, as they stayed away from their original place and were lagging behind financially and educationally, a few of them have also mixed with Maratha Kshatriyas changing their food and formalities, without any commitment to their original culture.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The birthday celebration of Sri Jihveshwara by the Swakulasali Samaj brethren, understanding the very gist of standard life, spiritual thinking, profession and sincerity to religion guided by Sri Jivehshwara and inculcating them in their life, is a meaningful celebration. It has become their tradition to perform special sixteen services of puja (shodashopachar), cradle function, lullaby - singing songs to make him sleep, reading Swakulasali purana, keertana-bhajana, chariot festival, distributing anna prasad, arranging functions for organizing the Samaj etc., spearheading religious and cultural programmes appropriately.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This Swakulasali Samaj is inseparable portion of Hindu religion. Due to globalization, industrialization and modernization the profession of weaving clothes has come to standstill resulting in severe threat to the very existence of the Samaj. Suffered from all these, the Samaj has become very poor, hesitating minded backward community. They are so innocent that they mingle with the local people and get localized easily. As Swakulasalis are Shaivas, they mingle in the language and living styles of Lingayats of north Karnataka and live as Veerashaivas without any difficulties. A few of them because of their satvik nature and practice of vaidik formalities they seem to be brahimins. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana there are people who forget their own Marathi language following their daily performance while co-living with Telugu linguist. In Tamil Nadu we need others assistance to recognize families of Swakulasali samaj. So, the scattered Swakulasalai Samaj having become lowest population, have depended on other professions going away from traditional weaving. In today's competitive world, Swakulasali Samaj brethren have to remain organized to retain their existence, for thorough development of Samaj brethren, celebrate Bhagawan Sri Jihveshwar jayanthi congregating in huge number through various Swakulasali oranisations established in leading cities of the country. There are organizations at national level and state level. Hostel and community homes are established in Molakalmuru with the assistance of Government. State level educational institution, Gurupeetha and Sri Jihweshwar Mandir are also being established there with the financial assistance of donors and well-wishers of the Samaj. Assistance of Government is sought for construction of Swakulaslai community homes in various cities of the country. The Samaj is looking forward to the helping hand of the Government to get land for suitable accommodation for state level development schemes of the community in the capital.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Facing many challenges in today's competitive world, knowing the speed, necessity and inevitability to cover the developmental path by the Swakulasali Samaj in various dimensions in several fields like religious, political, educational, industrial, commercial, technical, cultural, fine arts, sports, media, communication and social service, the present youth are marching ahead towards achievement under guidance of senior generation.
